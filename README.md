# Group Project - Landing Page

## Objective

So far, we’ve done a lot of work that involve finishing labs, meaning we’ve gotten the designs from someone else. This exercise is going to combine the skills we’ve learned from those exercises, as well as strengthen our own creative chops.

In this challenge, each group must design and build a landing page for your favorite person, place, or product, or brand. Here are a few examples:

[Beyonce](http://www.beyonce.com/)
[Visit Finland](http://www.visitfinland.com/)
[Taylor Swift](http://taylorswift.com/)
[The Fernway](http://thefernway.com/)
[iPhone](https://www.apple.com/iphone/)
[A bunch more](http://land-book.com/)

Think about what these sites have in common. How is the information laid out? What makes these sites appealing to look at? What would you change about them?

## Steps

### Choosing a Topic

Split up into your groups and choose a topic. *Don't get too hung up on your choice* You have a limited amount of time for this project - deciding on what you're building can't take up too much time. Remember, the joy of building something is in building it, not who you're building it for. 

### Storyboard/Wireframing

Start designing the layout of your page. Think about your design decisions and the user experience. What should the user see first? What information is the most important? 


### Building the Site

Have one person fork and clone this repository. This person should then add the other team members as collaborators. Decide on a workflow that suits your team. You have a deadline - it's your responsibility to decide how to meet it!
